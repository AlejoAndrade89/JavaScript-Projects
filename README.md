### To-Do App

This project is a simple To-Do App that allows users to manage their daily tasks. Users can add new tasks, view the list of tasks, and remove tasks when they are completed. The tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, ensuring that the task list persists even after the page is reloaded.

- JavaScript

**Features:**
- **Add Tasks:** Users can input a new task and add it to the list by clicking the "Add item" button.
- **View Tasks:** The app displays the list of tasks in an unordered list.
- **Remove Tasks:** Each task has a "remove" button next to it that allows users to delete the task from the list.
- **Persistent Storage:** Tasks are stored in the browser's local storage, so they remain even after the page is refreshed.

**Usage:**
- Open the app in a web browser.
- Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add item" button to add it to the list.
- Click the "x" button next to a task to remove it from the list.

### jQuery Demo
